# DataCo-Supply-Chain-Analytics
End-to-end supply chain analytics project using SQL Server and Power BI

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how end-to-end business analytics can transform complex supply chain data into clear, actionable insights for decision-makers.

Using the DataCo Supply Chain dataset, I designed a multi-layered analytics solution that supports strategic, operational, and commercial decision-making across the organization. Rather than focusing solely on visualization, the project emphasizes business logic, KPI consistency, and stakeholder relevance.

The solution integrates SQL Server for data preparation and modeling with Power BI for interactive reporting, ensuring data accuracy and performance at scale. Key business metrics such as sales, profit, delivery performance, customer behavior, and product profitability are standardized and reused across dashboards to maintain a single source of truth.

Four stakeholder-focused dashboards were delivered:
- Executive & Management Dashboard to monitor growth, profitability, and regional performance
- Operations & Supply Chain Dashboard to identify delivery risks and logistics inefficiencies
- Sales & Customer Insights Dashboard to analyze customer value, retention, and revenue drivers
- Product & Inventory Performance Dashboard to support pricing, assortment, and inventory decisions
  
Together, these dashboards illustrate how analytics can connect sales outcomes with operational performance, uncover hidden risks, and guide data-driven decision-making. The project reflects real-world Business Intelligence practices, including data cleaning, KPI design, analytical storytelling, and stakeholder alignment.
